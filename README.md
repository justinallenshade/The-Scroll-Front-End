# Project Issues

- We had trouble keeping our branches synced, and we had a difficult time with our form acceptung PUT requests.

## Your Error

- CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in package.json. error: Failed to merge in the changes. Patch failed at 0001 updating files.
- src/components/home.jsx line 21:5 react hook useeffect has a missing dependency: 'getposts'. either include it or remove the dependency array.

## Why you think you're getting this error

- Originally, we did not use the recommended gitflow but we found out that not committing often was one issue and syncing up branches that are similar was another.
- We were not completely sure about the issue with the missing dependency which was causing an infinite loop. 

## Everything you've tried

- We had to git add and git rebase often until we fixed all errors. 
- We changed our git flow to what was recommended by our instructors.
- We removed a variable called getPosts with another called htttp in the useEffect hook. 
- Plenty of Google searches
